Blocking queue: 
Indicates that the queue blocks the accessing thread if it is full (when the queue is bounded) or becomes empty.
If the queue is full, then adding a new element will block the accessing thread unless there is space available for the new element.
Similarly, if the queue is empty, then accessing an element blocks the calling thread.


Bounded:
A Queueu for which a size is specified while it is created. FIXED size queue.
An unbounded queue implies that the size of the queue is not specified while creating. 
Therefore, the queue can grow dynamically as elements are added to it.
